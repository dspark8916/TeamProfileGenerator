# TeamProfileGenerator

## Description

In this assignment, our challenge was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, we must ensure that all unit tests pass. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

## User Story
